Recovery-Tools
====================

This app requires [ROOT] access!
Please do not use this app thoughtless and evaluating them without deeper KNOWLEDGE for Android (Root, Custom Recovery, etc.)
I'm working to improve this app.

----- Description -----

This app flashes your device recovery without rebooting it very fast and easy. There are 3 flash options:

"Flash Clockworkmod-Recovery" and "Flash TWRP" (You can use these predefined buttons if they are supported.) and "Flash other".

"Flash Clockworkmod" & "Flash TWRP" load the custom-recovery for your device down and install them automatically.
"Flash other" lets you choose an image from the internal or external memory of your device additionally you can use your file browser to choose an img.

You can create backups of the currently installed system (If your device is supported. Shown below), restore and delete backups. You can find these functions under "Backup Manager".

This project is fully open-source if you want to help me with unsupported devices you can use the report button or contact me over XDA.

You can find the source code on GitHub: https://github.com/ashotmkrtchyan1995/Recovery-Tools
